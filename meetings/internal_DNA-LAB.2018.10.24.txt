Agenda: For the DNA-LAB
System = SeqDB, version = Version 3.18-SNAPSHOT 

1. Admin account: Users and Groups
1.1 Project Account
2. Public Portal
3. ABS : The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing
4. Bulk editing ?
5. -> The test-machine at digitalocean , health ? - Solution , IngiErli checks!
6. Future : Integration with Dina 

*************************************************************************

1.A Administration. Users 

There are different account types today : Admin, User, Guest.
Question 1 : on constraining users:
- Could we restrict User and/or Guest to only read-mode ?
Solution = We/RodrEspa - can try this out

Question 2 : User or Guest with Read-Write rights.
- can a 'User'  import files, can they bulk-edit files through export/import of excel ?
Solution = We/RodrEspa - can try this out

Todo -> Add users to the system(4 Users = Bo+Ve+Ra+Jo), have 2 administrators (R and M)

1.B Administration and Groups.
Suggestion:
- A) DNA-collection or DNA-Samlingen (Voucher-number, from the museum)
- B) CGI-collection or DNA-Samlingen (NON-voucher , temporary -> could become a 'voucher number')
- C) Work-collection or Work-Samlingen (temporary)
- - Different researchers, 1 'Work-Collection' for each researcher ?

Solution = We/RodrEspa - can try this out

1.1 Project.
- 'Project and Reporting' - Link
- the purpose is to be able to report, graphs
- 'Add a new project' -> 
'Group Options' + 'Project-Name' + 'Parent Project' + 'Project Status' + 'Project Details' + 'Source of Funding' + 'Duration from' - 'to' + 'Project Description' 
Every Collectoin; A,B,C could have 0 or more Projects.

2. Public Portal  (https://seqpublic.nrm.se/)
- Is everything visible from the SeqDB now ?
- - we should be able to have a boolean flag 'public'/'not public' - becoming visible/not visible in the portal

3. ABS
- we are able to add an attachment to every specimens
- - we tested to add 2 PDF-documents to the Collection Code = 'MOSS' with Specimen Identifier = 96.
Q : Does this fulfill our obiligations to the protocol ?

4. Problems with the bulk-editing now, did we choose the correct importer ?
- we need a short guide to explain ...

5. Needs a check ...

6. Future : Integration with Dina - postpone
- Se DINA as the 'master' when it comes to information on Specimens - See Group-C - and see SeqDB as 'slave'
- - or DINA is 'the source of truth, when it comes to specimens' (export DwC-A from DINA, import DwC-A to SeqDB ?)
- Light integration, 'there are samples' and 'there are NO samples' .... if samples, a link to SeqDB (ask R for credentials) - one 'guest-user' with read-rights ? or a link to the public portal ?
- Not-so-light integration ->
